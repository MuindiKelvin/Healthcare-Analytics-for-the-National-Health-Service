This project focuses on developing the "NHS Early Risk Detection and Intervention Framework: Cardiovascular Module,” a new healthcare analytic tool designed especially for the requirements of the NHS. The initial goal was to develop a patient-oriented, evidence-based tool for the early identification of high-risk cardiovascular patients so that prompt interventions and healthcare resources could be utilized most efficiently. NHS terminology, units, and colors were built into the framework to ensure that it remains as practically relevant as possible to the NHS. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) models were used to analyze the data and determine the probability of having a heart attack. The models were assessed based on accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. Although the models achieved good recall and slightly above-average F1 scores, the AUC values suggested further optimization for improved accuracy. The project also emphasizes the developmental nature of the framework and the ongoing cooperation with healthcare workers to address the evolving requirements of the NHS appropriately. When fully optimized, the framework can considerably impact patients' health, the productivity of resources, and the NHS’s goal of providing equal access to quality care to the population.
